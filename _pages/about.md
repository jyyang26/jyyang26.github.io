üëã Hi there, my name is Junyao Yang, a final year undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science** at the [School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/), [South China University of Technology(SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/). My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Language Models. Here is my **[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17UEE4NB9HbyNba8TwQ5oO3y3Tu7hwhZm/view?usp=sharing)**.

My research story revolves around **the Underlying Principles and Understanding of LLMs**, particularly focusing on how to enhance the **"Reliability"** and **"Safety"** of LLM-generated information, which connects to related areas such as **LLM Privacy**, **Knowledge Editing** and **Malicious Attacks** of LLMs and so on:

- **Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence**
- **LLM Privacy**
