üëã Hi there, my name is Junyao Yang. I am a final-year undergraduate student in Computer Science at the School of Computer Science & Engineering, South China University of Technology (SCUT). I am also an incoming graduate student at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore(NUS), where I will be pursuing a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests lie in **Natural Language Processing** and **Language Models**. Here is my **[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17UEE4NB9HbyNba8TwQ5oO3y3Tu7hwhZm/view?usp=sharing)**.

My research story revolves around **the Underlying Principles and Understanding of LLMs**, particularly focusing on how to enhance the **"Reliability"** and **"Safety"** of LLM-generated information, which connects to related areas such as **LLM Privacy** [**[PrivacyRestore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01394)**, **[RewardDS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18517)**], **Knowledge Editing** [In Progress] and **Malicious Attacks** [**[PrivacyRestore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01394)**], of LLMs and so on:

- **Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence**
- **LLM Privacy**
